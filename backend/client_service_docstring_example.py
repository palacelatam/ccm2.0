class ClientService:
    """
    Central orchestrator for client-related operations in CCM 2.0.

    The ClientService acts as the main coordinator for trade processing,
    email confirmation handling, matching workflows, and client configuration
    management. It integrates with multiple services to provide a complete
    trade confirmation workflow.

    Attributes:
        db: CMEK-enabled Firestore client instance
        csv_parser: Service for parsing CSV trade files
        email_parser: Service for extracting data from email files
        llm_service: AI service for trade data extraction
        matching_service: Fuzzy matching algorithm implementation
        task_queue: Background job scheduling service
        auto_email_service: Automated email notification service
        auto_sms_service: Automated SMS notification service
        logger: Configured logger for this service

    Example:
        ```python
        from services.client_service import ClientService

        # Initialize the service
        client_service = ClientService()

        # Process a trade upload
        result = await client_service.process_csv_upload(

            filename="trades.csv"
        )
        ```

    Note:
        This service handles approximately 2700+ lines of business logic
        and should be considered for refactoring into smaller services.
